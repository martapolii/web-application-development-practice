**In visual studio:**
1. Create a react app with firebase authentication 
 `npx create-react-app react-auth-firebase`

 output with helpful commands:
 ```
 To address all issues (including breaking changes), run:
  npm audit fix --force

Run `npm audit` for details.

Created git commit.

Success! Created react-auth-firebase at C:\P\C229-Code\W11_Firebase\react-auth-firebase
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-auth-firebase
  npm start

Happy hacking!
```

2. cd into the `react-auth-folder` and start the appliation 
```
cd react-auth-firebase
  npm start
```
- now have a react app with firebase in browser:
